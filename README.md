# ite523
Hi Team,
This is the home of my various weekly LABS for ITE523 by IT Masters and Charles Sturt Univeristy.
I am currently studying docker as an elective for my never ending MBA project, which tilts me towards a cloud virtualisation degree (under management). 
Now remember, I am learning docker, ie: DONT FOLLOW ME, I'M LOST TOO

Many thanks for stopping by, respect to the contributors to the labs and code, its a pleasure learning from your tuition and hardwork creating the course(s).
